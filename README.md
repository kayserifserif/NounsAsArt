hello! i made a (first?) twitter bot! its name is @NounsAsArt and i've been checking it repeatedly in excitement since it went live last night. i'd love if you could check it out and offer up some examples, if you feel so inclined 😊  

![a screenshot of the twitter profile](twitter.jpg)

i was thinking about the way people can see so many things as ~art~, even if they're not remotely related to art and not typically seen as art. it can be a beautiful way to see the world and also a great source of creative inspiration  

the bot is tweeting through a list of 6,775 nouns, as curated by @eco_desi at http://desiquintans.com/nounlist. it was built (SO quickly and easily!! 🤩) with #CheapBotsDoneQuick by @v21  

the two images on the profile are @alharding’s “visible light” and wang hai’s “from tsuen wan to central” (王亥「從荃灣到中環」), which are two images that represent moments of life that have made me feel ~art~ – specifically light/domesticity and crowds  

my hope is for this to be a kind of creative crowdsourcing experiment, that we can learn to see the world in the weird and wonderful ways that others see it, and make art out of it (“art”, as always, expansively defined here)  

(potential futures: a searchable spreadsheet of some sort containing everyone's associations, examples, links, comments to each NounsAsArt?)
